    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jollof Rice is one of the most common West African dishes eaten in various
      countries in region. It is a versatile dish made from rice and other
      delicious ingredients
    </p>
    <p>It is inexpensive and easy to make yet, delicious</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Pimento peppers</li>
      <li>Tomato paste</li>
      <li>Scotch bonnet</li>
      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>and spices...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to
        start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes.
        The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich
        tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for
        another two minutes; Actually, by the time this ready, you will notice
        it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk
        burning them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for
        frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick and
        the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the
        water is gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know
        but just in case, you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 20 to 25
        minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt,
        white pepper (good but optional) and seasoning cubes. Adjust the
        seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on
        point, then, I stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly
        until you cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. Now add the chicken
        stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If
        your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with a foil paper
        before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of
        steam in order to turn out well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low
        immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done about 20 to 25
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or
        Gizzards and plantains.
