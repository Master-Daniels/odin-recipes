    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will
      love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop
      recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular
      honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk
      too.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your grill to medium heat and oil the grate</li>
      <li>
        Then lightly brush the glaze over the chops and smear them on both sides
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill your pork chops until they are no longer pink in the middle and
        reach an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
        The National Pork Board recommends about eight to 12 minutes for pork
        chops that are ¾-inch thick. However, every grill is different so it may
        take some grills longer while some may cook faster.

        If you don't have a grill or the weather isn't looking that great
        outside, you can bake these pork chops instead. Reviewers tend to bake
        them at 350 degrees F for about 40-45 minutes, or until the internal
        temperature reaches 145 degrees F.
