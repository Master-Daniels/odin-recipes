    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      If you want to make efo riro the yoruba way, it is important you use
      locust beans, smoked fish/dried fish and palm oil. Every other thing you
      decide to add after the core ingredients just complements it. Also, you
      need coarsely blended pepper to make the vegetable soup.
    </p>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <h2>Preps And Tips</h2>
    <p>
      I used smoked dried ponmo for this recipe, you can also use fresh ones if
      you want. If you are using the dried ones, soak them in warm water for at
      least 36-48 hours. Wash ponmo clean (use clean wired scourers for an
      easier job) and set aside
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pick the vegetable from the stalk and slice into chunks Rinse vegetable
        clean, drain and set aside
      </li>
      <li>Wash locust beans and set aside</li>
      <li>Chop 1 onion and set aside</li>
      <li>Shred the smoked fish into flakes and also set aside</li>
      <li>
        Roughly chop the bell pepper (tatashe) and onions, add to a blender and
        pulse for coarse texture (alternatively, use a food processor for
        perfect coarse texture)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place a pan on medium heat and add palm oil, heat for about 5 minutes
        but donâ€™t bleach
      </li>
      <li>
        Followed by iru woro, chopped onions and fry in the oil for about 2
        minutes (In this case I used half of the locust beans and saved the rest
        to be used before I finished cooking the soup).
      </li>
      <li>Add blended pepper to the palm oil and stir to combine</li>
      <li>
        After about 3 minutes, add the remaining locust beans. Move on to add
        the diced ponmo and ground crayfish and cook for another 3-4 minutes on
        low heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Add seasoning and pinch of salt. (check for salt at the later stage of
        the cooking)
      </li>
      <li>
        Whilst you are waiting for the sauce to cook, boil water enough to cover
        the vegetable. Once the water is boiled, pour over the vegetable and
        cover with a lid for 5-10 minutes. Strain and squeeze out excess water
        from the vegetable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to cook the sauce till oil floats on the top, add half of the
        smoked fish, dried smelt fish and stir to combine. (You can add little
        water to the sauce if it is too dry but do not overdo it as efo riro is
        almost water free)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the vegetable to the sauce and stir till all is well incorporated
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining smoked mackerel and carefully combine in the
        vegetable. Check for salt and cook for another 4 minutes. Take it off
        the heat and set aside. Serve efo riro soup with a swallow of choice or
        rice and you can even choose to eat it on its own.
